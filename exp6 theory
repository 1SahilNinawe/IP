Theory:
JavaScript is a versatile and lightweight scripting language that allows for dynamic interaction with HTML and CSS, making it a powerful tool for building interactive web applications. When integrated with HTML forms, JavaScript can be used to perform client-side validation. Form validation ensures that user input adheres to specified requirements, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of data submitted through web forms. By checking the data before it reaches the server, JavaScript helps reduce unnecessary server requests and enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback.

Common types of validations include:

Presence Validation: Ensuring that all required fields have been filled.
Range Validation: Checking if a numeric input falls within a specified range.
Pattern Validation: Validating if input values match a specific pattern (e.g., email addresses).
Type Validation: Ensuring that input is of the expected type, such as numeric or text.
In a registration form, fields like name, email, password, and mobile numbers are often validated. JavaScript functions can be written to check for empty fields, valid email formats, or number ranges. This provides a layer of security and ensures that the data submitted is consistent and follows the expected format.

For example, a JavaScript function can verify if an email address contains an "@" symbol and a "." symbol, ensuring it follows the general structure of an email address. This type of validation reduces the likelihood of users submitting incorrect data, which could lead to errors or security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion:
Thus, by using JavaScript, we can efficiently validate input data on the client side, providing a smoother and faster user experience. JavaScriptâ€™s ability to validate form fields helps ensure that data integrity is maintained, preventing users from submitting incomplete or incorrect information. This results in cleaner data for backend processing and reduces server load by catching errors before they are submitted.
