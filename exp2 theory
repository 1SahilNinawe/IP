Viva Theory: Creating a Placement Registration Form using HTML5 Elements
Introduction: HTML5 provides enhanced features for creating more structured and user-friendly web forms. HTML forms are used to collect input data from users and send it to the server for processing. The <form> element is a container for all the input controls, like text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and more.

Importance of HTML Forms: Forms are essential for interactive web applications where user input is needed, such as registration forms, surveys, and feedback forms. They enable the exchange of data between users and servers, making web applications more dynamic and responsive to user needs.

HTML Form Structure: A basic HTML form includes the following elements:

<form>: Defines the beginning of the form. Contains attributes like action (where the form data is sent) and method (how the data is sent, e.g., GET or POST).
<input>: Creates various types of user input controls, like text fields, passwords, checkboxes, etc.
<label>: Associates descriptive text with input elements.
<select> and <option>: Creates dropdown menus for selecting one of several options.
<button> or <input type="submit">: Triggers the form submission.
HTML5 Form Elements: HTML5 introduced new input types like email, date, and range, as well as validation features that enhance user experience and ensure the correctness of input data before submission.


Conclusion: This form collects essential information from students for placement registration, including personal details, technical skills, and preferences. HTML5â€™s input types and validation features ensure data integrity and enhance user experience.

Theory for Viva:
In this experiment, we studied and implemented HTML5 form controls to create a placement registration form. HTML forms allow user inputs to be captured and sent to a server for processing. We used various HTML5 elements such as:

Text Input (<input type="text">): Used to capture user input like name, roll number, etc.
Password Field (<input type="password">): Used to capture sensitive information like passwords.
Email Field (<input type="email">): Ensures a valid email format is entered by the user.
Radio Buttons (<input type="radio">): Allows selection of one option from a group of predefined choices.
Checkboxes (<input type="checkbox">): Used to select multiple options, if needed.
Drop-down List (<select>): Provides a list of choices where only one option can be selected.
Submit Button (<input type="submit">): Triggers form submission.
These controls were wrapped inside the <form> tag and organized using <fieldset> and <legend> for a better user experience. Each element has attributes like name, id, and value, which ensure correct data transmission to the server. The correct input validation, such as for emails and passwords, was achieved using HTML5 features.

Conclusion for Viva:
In this experiment, we learned how to design and implement a fully functional placement registration form using HTML5 elements. We explored various form controls like text boxes, password fields, email fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown lists, and understood their roles in capturing user data. We also implemented form validation, ensuring inputs like email are in a valid format. By using <fieldset> and <legend>, we grouped related form controls, improving the structure and clarity of the form.
