The framework also includes pre-defined CSS classes for typography, colors, spacing, and other elements, allowing developers to achieve a polished design with minimal custom CSS.

As a result, Bootstrap speeds up the development process while ensuring that the final product is visually appealing and compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers.
