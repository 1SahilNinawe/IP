Theory for Viva:
A portfolio is a personal website or page designed to showcase an individual's skills, experiences, projects, and qualifications. It is primarily used by professionals, freelancers, and students to present their work to potential employers, clients, or academic institutions. In web development, creating a portfolio with HTML5 is a fundamental exercise, utilizing a variety of HTML elements and attributes to structure and style the page.

The key elements of a student portfolio include:

Hero Section: The first section users see, often including an introduction and a call-to-action, such as “Contact Me” or “View Projects.”
About Me Section: Provides a brief description of the individual, covering education, interests, work experience, and skills.
Projects Section: Lists notable projects in chronological or logical order. This section can include details such as the technologies used, personal contributions, and images of the projects.
Contact Section: Contains contact information, including email, social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub), and other communication channels.
HTML5 elements such as <div>, <header>, <footer>, <img>, <table>, and <a> are used to organize content and create a visually appealing and functional webpage. The <div> tag helps structure the page into different sections, while the <img> tag adds images. The anchor tag <a> is used for hyperlinks, and the <header> and <footer> tags define the top and bottom sections of the page, respectively.

In addition, lists (<ul>, <li>) are employed to organize items, and the use of tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>) enables content to be displayed in rows and columns. Styling and responsive behavior can be enhanced through external CSS.

Conclusion for Viva:
In conclusion, creating a student portfolio webpage using HTML5 is a valuable exercise in web development that demonstrates the effective use of semantic HTML elements. A well-structured portfolio not only highlights the individual’s skills, experiences, and projects but also provides an opportunity to make a lasting impression on potential employers or academic evaluators. By using HTML5 elements such as <div>, <header>, <footer>, <img>, and <a>, along with lists, tables, and forms, we can organize content in a clear and accessible way. Additionally, incorporating CSS enhances the design, ensuring the webpage is both visually appealing and responsive across devices.

Theory:
In this experiment, we studied how to create a portfolio webpage using HTML5 elements. A portfolio is a powerful tool to showcase personal skills, projects, and experiences online. It provides a visual representation of professional abilities, allowing potential employers or clients to evaluate work samples effectively.

Key HTML5 tags such as <div>, <img>, <span>, <a>, and others were used to structure different sections of the webpage. The <div> tag is a block-level element used to group various tags and sections together, while the <span> tag is an inline container. The <img> tag was utilized to embed images in the portfolio, and the <a> tag was used for hyperlinks.

Additional elements like <header> and <footer> were employed to define the structural components of the webpage, whereas tables, lists, and frames (though deprecated in HTML5) were used to manage and present data.

By combining these tags, a clean and organized portfolio can be created, providing a professional online presence.

Conclusion:
Thus, we successfully implemented a student portfolio using various HTML5 elements such as <div>, <img>, <table>, <ul>, <footer>, etc. The experiment allowed us to explore how HTML structures content on web pages, with special emphasis on the use of HTML5 semantic tags for better organization and readability.
